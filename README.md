# Image Classifier Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `image_classifier.ipynb`, which demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

- **Installation of Dependencies**: Installing required libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing images for training the model.
- **Model Training**: Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
- **Results Visualization**: Visualizing the classification results.

## Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh-Mathur-1503/opensourcelab.git
   cd opensourcelab
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `image_classifier.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code.

## Results

The notebook includes sections that train the model and visualize the classification results, providing insights into the model's accuracy and performance.
